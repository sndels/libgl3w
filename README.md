# libgl3w

A pre-generated (May 2017) version of gl3w. Can also be built as a static lib using
cmake.

## Usage

For use as a static lib in a project, add this directory as a subdirectory in
your CMakeLists. Then just link against `libgl3w` as it has a public include-directory.

Released with the Unlicense as is the case with gl3w. However, this doesn't apply
for glcorearb.h, which includes it's own license.
